# Detect, Evaluate and Automate: AIOps with Ansible and OpenShift AI

## Overview

This project demonstrates a powerful, event-driven architecture that leverages Red Hat OpenShift AI to automate IT incident response. By integrating Event-Driven Ansible (EDA) with an AI/ML pipeline, this solution can automatically detect issues, gather diagnostics, generate incident reports, and create ignition remediation playbooks that engineers can use to serve as a starting point to write their remediation playbook instead of writing it from scratch.



### Use Case

In modern IT environments, responding to system failures quickly and effectively is crucial. This proof of concept demo showcases how AIOps can be incorporated into the workflow that begins with a Incident Alert (like a web server failure) and lead to a faster closure. This AIOps approach aims to automate the writing of initial incident report and initial remdiation playbook leading to quicker escalation and remediation of an Incident Alert.

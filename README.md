# Detect, Evaluate and Automate: AIOps with Ansible and OpenShift AI

## Overview

This project demonstrates a powerful, event-driven architecture that leverages Red Hat OpenShift AI to automate IT incident response. By integrating Event-Driven Ansible (EDA) with an AI/ML pipeline, this solution can automatically detect issues, gather diagnostics, generate incident reports, and create ignition remediation playbooks that engineers can use to serve as a starting point to write their remediation playbook instead of writing it from scratch.

In modern IT environments, responding to system failures quickly and effectively is crucial. This demo showcases how AIOps can be incorporated in the workflow that begins with a system event (like a web server failure) and uses AI to generate a precise, actionable response. This AIOps approach reduces manual toil, minimizes downtime, and allows IT teams to focus on higher-value tasks.
